# TodaysSongs

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the directory `lib/todays_songs/` and add the `require_relative "[path]"` to file `lib/todays_songs.rb`. To experiment with that code, declare an instance of that code to file `bin/todays_songs` and run `./bin/todays_songs` in the terminal for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'todays_songs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install todays_songs

## Usage

See `NOTES.md`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
